# As a youth
I started swimming at around 10years old with Wisbech Swimming Club, I competed in Gala's for Wisbech over the years until I eventually stopped around at 17 when I learned to drive and took my Rugby more seriously than swimming.

# Masters
Oddly in competitive swimming, the senior age group is from age 18-25. Anything over 25 is classed as a masters swimmer, so while in the pool a "senior citizen" is not classed as a senior swimmer, but instead a "master swimmer". While you may compete in the pool with other swimmers of any age (over 18) as the heats are always grouped by entry times. When it comes to the results The "masters" category is divided into 5 year age groups, so every 5 years you move into a new age group with its own set of records to aim at. 
I digress, I swam for a couple of years in my early 30's but only did one competition in that time and I wasn't particularly serious about it, it was a means to keep fit.
Similarly, when Covid came I found the pounds going back on so figured it was time to get acquainted  with the local pool! I started swimming 2-3 times per week. 

# Team Anglia
Around Aug/Sept 2022, I somehow heard about the national masters championships (probably from my brother?!) that were scheduled for late October. Due to covid, they had abolished any qualifying time requirements as there had been so few competitions for people to be able to get qualifying times in! I quickly joined Team Anglia Masters Swimming club and signed up for a couple of races! That was the hook. I've been to every nationals meet since 2022 and generally compete in about 8-10 gala's throughout the year. I am nowhere near the fastest swimmer in my age group, but I enjoy training with my good friend Andy, and the social aspect of meeting other swimmers and the rest of Team Anglia at various galas around the UK.

# My times
The table below shows my 50-54 age-group personal best times, alongside those that my mum had kept from my days swimming with Wisbech (note I have no idea if those where my PBs at my "peak" or just at some point in my teens!):
