Here you will find links to a variety of pages that I am involved with during my spare time.

# [Painting]({{ '/pages/aboutme/paintings' | relative_url }})

I sometimes enjoy picking up a paintbrush and spending a few hours daubing paint onto a canvas, I'm not particularly good at it, but its a fun way to pass the time, especially with a beer and good company.

# [Me and the]({{ '/pages/aboutme/gsc' | relative_url }}) [GSC](www.gensc.org)

This page could fall under the work category, if it were a paid ocupation! But its a purely voluntary role so I thought it best to include it here! There may be other mentions of my involvement with the GSC in other places on my website as it's been something I have been involved with for such a long time and it has closely overlapped with my working life.

# [Betty the Triumph Herald]({{ '/pages/aboutme/betty' | relative_url }})

On occassion, in fine weather, my wife and I enjoy going out in our classic car, a 1969 Triumph Herald that we've named Betty-Blue.

# [Masters Swimming]({{ '/pages/aboutme/swimming' | relative_url }})

Since the onset of middle-age and the effects of a very sedentary life-style brought about by Covid I took up swimming again. This page includes my competitions and training programs
