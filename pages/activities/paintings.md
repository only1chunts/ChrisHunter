Sometime ago I realised that my entire life revolved around science, so I figured it was about time to explore the artistic world a little more so my wife and I went to a "paint 'n' sip" class where we drank a little and painted a landscape scene under instructions in a step by step manner.
I soon found that I dont mush like being told HOW to paint, but I did enjoy the process of actually doing it, so I've since done a bunch more. Here is a selection of paintings I've done over the years.
