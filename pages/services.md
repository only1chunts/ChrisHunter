Here are some of the services that I can provide on a contract or task basis:

# Data cleaning
Standardisation of metadata term names to common nomenclature, handle null values consistently, clean typographic and other minor data-entry errors.


# Data transformation
Transform a dataset from one format to another without loss of metadata and with integrity checks to ensure its completness and meaning has been maintained.


# Data merging
When you have multiple sources of data that need to be combined into a single dataset often there are transformations required to make the data the same shape to be able to merge them.


# Biocuration tasks
Extract relevant information on specicif biological artifacts from literature or other sources.


# Ontology mapping
Map metadata values to reference ontologies. Or map two related/overlapping ontologies/controlled vocabularies.


# Database Schema design
Enable integration of multiple metadata tables through relevant key-values in a suitable database schema for ease of index and searching of linked data.


# Scrum Product Owner
If you have a scrum team working on a product that requires an experienced scrum product owner to aid guide the team and interact with all the stakeholders, I can be available on a part time basis.


# Simple website creation 
Using GitHub pages I have created multiple website, including this one! So if you need something relatively simple (that can be achieved using GitHub pages) to showcase yourself or your work I can assist with that.


Contact me with your requirements for a estimated cost.
